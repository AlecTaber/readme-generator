## Installation

To install this generator, first you will need to clone down the repository from GitHub. When you have the repository cloned to your local machine, you then will need to navigate to the repository using your terminal. Next, you will need to install the "inquirer" module using NodeJS. Once these steps have been followed, you should be able to run the generator by typing "node index.js" into your terminal.

## Usage

To use this generator, you need to make sure you have NodeJS intalled and have the "inquirer" module installed. When the index.js is ran through NodeJS, you will be asked a series of questions about your project you are currently working on and your contact information. After the questions are answered, it will generate a markdown file with your answers formatted in the style of a README.
